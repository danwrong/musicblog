The band is comprised of 13 and 15 year old siblings Ada and Ivan along with assorted elders on the skins.  The band has achieved minor popularity and have had a video featured on Subterranean, despite having received a <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13096-skeletons/\">poor review from Pitchfork</a>.  The review essentially stated some might find this good or impressive because it is coming from a couple of youngsters and not on artistic merit.  I happen to like this song and a few others from the record, though I can see many people not enjoying it at all.
